## Fun Fact

Did you know that in Japan, it's common for people to fall asleep in public without being judged? It's called "inemuri" and is often seen as a sign of hard work and dedication!

You can also check out some of my artwork on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/s4shiro), where I occasionally post both AI-generated art and self-drawn pieces.
